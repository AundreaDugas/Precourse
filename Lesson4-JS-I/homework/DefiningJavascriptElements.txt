Feynman Writing Prompts - In a seprate text file that you create, 
write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining 
it to a 12 year old. Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in
 your understanding. Ask your questions on Slack.

Variables are values that we tell the computer to remember for future use. 
    We use var (This is the old way of writing a variable so we won't be using
     this much. Here, values can be changed later on.), let(This is used when 
     we want to change something later on.), and const(Constant creates a variable
      that can't be changed, just like a science experiment constant is not changed.)
       to define our variables. Variables can represent numbers or words.
Strings are simply words and sentences. They can't be manipulated like numbers can.
     We use quotes to designate a string.
Functions are like math equations. We are manipulating what is 
    there and ending with something different. Arguments are what we plug into the math 
    equation (function). For example the function would be a+b=c. The values we put in for
     a and b (lets set them as 1 and 5) are the arguments. Our return value will be our answer
      (c which is 6 in this example).
If statements are ways we exclude possible answers to our functions. For example, if the person's
     age is greater than 18, the person is considered an adult. So if you ask if a 17 year old is an adult, then
      an adult, the answer would be false or no. If you ask about a 23 year old, the answer would be true or yes.
Boolean values (true, false) are true/false decisions. You can ask the computer if the
    statement "2 is an odd number" is true or false and it will decide it is a False statement.
